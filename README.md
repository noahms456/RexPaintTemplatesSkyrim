Planning on using RexPaint to draw full maps and geomorphs to describe the architecture of Skyrim maps.
To convert the .rx files directly into editable cells for the Gamebryo (or whatever it is) engine and the
CreationKit (import probably handled by a Papyrus script a la the Mundusform method...)

Don't get excited - I haven't coded anything of use in about 25 years
