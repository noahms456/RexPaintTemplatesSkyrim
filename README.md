Planning on using RexPaint to draw full maps and geomorphs to describe the architecture of Skyrim maps.

To convert the .rx files directly into editable cells for the Skyrim engine and the
CreationKit (import probably handled by a Papyrus script a la the Mundusform method...)

Don't get excited - I haven't coded anything of use in about 25 years.

To include RexReader library, possibly some maze and dungen-style automated generation, as well as some
Brogue/Nethack/Angband-style tunneling and pacing. Probably the first implementations will include spawn
points for dungeon-entry, encounters, and exits.

Rexreader ---> in
Parse symbols with code in array style
----> out to CK statics and coordinates

Could be useful for DnD - see the Karcero CSS visualizer
